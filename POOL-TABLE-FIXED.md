# 🎱 **POOL TABLE VISIBILITY FIXED!**

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **🎮 Canvas Display Issues:**
1. **Proper Canvas Initialization**: Fixed game world initialization to ensure it creates properly
2. **Canvas Visibility**: Made sure canvas has green pool table background and proper sizing
3. **Display Timing**: Added delays and forced redraws to ensure game renders
4. **Canvas Resize**: Trigger proper canvas resizing when switching to game mode

### **🖥️ Visual Improvements:**
1. **Pool Table Green**: Added green background color to canvas (`#0f4c0f`)
2. **Full Screen Display**: Canvas now takes up proper screen space
3. **Better Positioning**: Fixed z-index and positioning issues
4. **Responsive Sizing**: Canvas scales properly on different screen sizes

### **🎯 Game Initialization:**
1. **Check Game World**: Added checks to ensure `Game.gameWorld` exists before using it
2. **Force Initialize**: Call `Game.initialize()` if game world doesn't exist
3. **Force Redraw**: Added `Game.gameWorld.draw()` calls after short delays
4. **Proper Timing**: Ensure canvas is visible before trying to draw to it
