## 🎯 **How to Test & Fix Black Screen:**

### **Step 1: Test Canvas Rendering**
1. **Open the game** in your browser
2. **Look for RED button** "TEST CANVAS (Click if black screen)"
3. **Click the red button**
4. **You should see:**
   - Green background (pool table)
   - White, red, yellow, and black balls
   - Text "CANVAS TEST - POOL TABLE"

### **Step 2: If Canvas Test Works**
- **Canvas is working** - problem is with game initialization

- **Check console** for game initialization errors

### **Step 3: If Canvas Test Fails**
- **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
- **Try different browser** (Chrome recommended)
