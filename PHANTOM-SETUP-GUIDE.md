- Try again in a few moments

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### Keep Your Wallet Safe
- **Never share your secret recovery phrase**
- **Use a strong, unique password**
- **Only connect to trusted websites**
- **Always verify transaction details before signing**

### For Pool Game Specifically
- The game only requests connection permission
- No automatic transactions - you control all approvals
- Rewards are accumulated locally until you choose to claim
- Transaction fees are minimal on devnet

## ðŸ’¡ Understanding the Reward System

### How It Works
1. **Play and Earn**: Every action in the game mines tokens
2. **Accumulate**: Tokens are stored until you reach minimum (10 tokens)
3. **Claim**: Convert game tokens to SOL rewards in your wallet
4. **Real Value**: Tokens have real value on Solana blockchain

### Token Economics
- **Daily Check-in**: 10+ tokens per day
- **Gameplay Mining**: Tokens per shot/pot/win
- **Mini-games**: 5-50 tokens per completion
- **Heat Rewards**: Bonus tokens at milestones

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Once your wallet is set up:
1. âœ… Connect to the pool game
2. âœ… Complete your first daily check-in
3. âœ… Play mini-games for bonus rewards
4. âœ… Enjoy earning while gaming!
